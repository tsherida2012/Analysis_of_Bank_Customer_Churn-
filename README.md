Baileys Bank, a global leader in the banking sector, faces a significant challenge with its 15% customer turnover rate. This high churn rate poses risks of diminished revenue, loss of critical customer insights, and potential reputational damage. Effectively, understanding and managing customer churn are crucial for banks to maintain financial stability and safeguard their reputation. The financial impact of customer churn for banks is significant, resulting in potential revenue loss across various banking services. Establishing and nurturing long-term customer relationships is highly valuable for banks. By gaining insight into churning patterns, banks can identify customers at risk of leaving and implement strategies to keep them. This approach enhances overall customer lifetime value and bolsters bank profitability.


To address this, Baileys Bank commits to conducting a deep analysis of customer data to uncover the reasons behind customer departures and the factors influencing their decisions. This vital analysis will enable the bank to enhance its services for both existing and potential customers, with a strategic goal of reducing the turnover rate to below 10% by the end of the beginning of the first quarter.


The bank recognizes the urgency of understanding the high turnover rate and is determined to mitigate it. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing customer records, we aim to provide valuable insights into the reasons customers choose to stay or leave. This information is crucial for the bank to refine its focus on key retention factors.


A significant reduction in customer churn will measure our success, exceeding 5%, with the expectation of seeing tangible results by the first quarter of next year. These findings will not only inform and enhance Baileys Bankâ€™s customer satisfaction and loyalty programs, but also aid in the development of tailored customer engagement strategies.


A critical part of our approach includes identifying customers at risk of churn before they decide to exit, allowing for timely and effective interventions.

In our pursuit to reduce churn, we are mindful of two key constraints: First; it is imperative to maintain or elevate our service quality across the entire customer base, not just those deemed at risk. We acknowledge the inherent challenges in predicting customer behavior. Factors influencing

customer churn can often be complex and multifaceted, posing a challenge to expect and address effectively.


Our key stakeholders in this initiative include the CEO, CFO, CTO, and Customer Service Managers, each playing a pivotal role in guiding and implementing our strategies. Data acquisition is crucial to our analysis, as such the CTO will provide us with access to the customer records dataset stored in their Postgresql database.

By making a focused effort, Baileys Bank aims to both decrease customer attrition and solidify its reputation as a customer-focused and innovative financial institution.
